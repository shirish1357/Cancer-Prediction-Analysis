## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
There are no additional libraries required beyond the standard Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python 3.X. The key libraries used in this project include:
pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

## Project Motivation
For this project, I was interested in using machine learning to analyze factors influencing cancer diagnosis. Specifically, I wanted to investigate:

1. Which factors (e.g., age, BMI, lifestyle habits) have the strongest correlation with cancer diagnosis?
2. How do lifestyle choices, such as smoking, alcohol intake, and physical activity, influence cancer risk?
3. Which features are the most important in predicting cancer risk?
4. How well can a machine learning model predict whether a patient is likely to be diagnosed with cancer?

The dataset used in this project was obtained from Kaggle and contains 1,500 patient records with medical and lifestyle attributes.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
